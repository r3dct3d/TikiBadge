DC25, BSidesLV-2017 hacker badge


Here are the schematics and 3D print files for the badge.  I will drop the code here shorly as well.

If you'd like other files, or more information on the badge, what we were trying to accomplish or why we do this please feel free to contact me at redacted@tek4art.com.  

*** If you received a badge at BSidesLV or Defcon please contact either myself or @notyep (twiter).  We release some pre-done versions of the badge that we would really like to either replace with finished badges or finish the one your received.  We would also be especially delighted if you'd like to drop me a note with any feedback or suggestions you might have.

Thank you for your support.
